- Web CI workflow now runs Prettier check.

## 2025-08-08 (0.12.11)
- Added Node.js 20 and npm installation to devcontainer Dockerfile to enable front-end tooling (`web/`).

## 2025-08-08 (0.12.12)
- Added project-specific `requirements/default.txt` and `requirements/dev.txt` replacing LegacyCode dependency installation.
- Dockerfile now copies and installs these requirements during build.
- devcontainer postCreateCommand now installs the project in editable mode (`pip install -e .`).

## 2025-08-08 (0.12.13)
- Devcontainer improvements:
  - Added build tools (`build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `libpq-dev`) and `docker.io` to Dockerfile for Python packages with native extensions and Testcontainers support.
  - Added `vscode` user to `docker` group and bind-mounted host Docker socket to enable Testcontainers inside container.
  - Updated `postCreateCommand` to install front-end dependencies via `npm ci --prefix web`.

## 2025-08-08 (0.12.14)
- Devcontainer build fix: added `gnupg` and `dirmngr` packages so NodeSource script can import GPG key during Node installation.

## 2025-08-08 (0.12.15)
- Fixed devcontainer build failure: set `build.context` to `..` so Docker build can access `requirements/` directory at workspace root.

## 2025-08-08 (0.12.16)
- Changed devcontainer `postCreateCommand` from `npm ci` to `npm install` because `web/package-lock.json` does not yet exist.

## 2025-08-08 (0.12.17)
- Improved `postCreateCommand`: now runs via bash with `set -e`, installs Python package first, then conditionally runs `npm ci` or `npm install` inside `web/`, ensuring proper directory context and early failure on errors.

## 2025-08-09 (0.12.18)
- Added `email-validator` runtime dependency because Pydantic models rely on it for `EmailStr` validation.
- Kept `httpx` at ^0.27.0 for compatibility with FastAPI’s pinned Starlette, avoiding TestClient breakage.

## 2025-08-09 (0.12.19)
- Synced Python requirements: added `httpx==0.27.0` and `email-validator==2.2.0` to `requirements/default.txt` so the devcontainer rebuild installs them automatically.

## 2025-08-09 (0.12.20)
- Re-enabled strict ESLint rules and fixed remaining lint errors across the web front-end:
  * Removed duplicate `SnackbarContext` in favour of typed `components/Snackbar.tsx`.
  * Typed Snackbar helpers, removed `// @ts-nocheck`, replaced undefined returns.
  * Cleaned `TopNav` unused import, fixed import order warnings.
  * Added `@types/uuid` devDependency and updated `ProfileWizard` to use typed UUID.
  * Suppressed false-positive `react/no-unknown-property` on MUI `Typography`.
- Fixed backend test failure: exported `sync_dummy.delay` from scheduler again so `test_scan_due_profiles` can monkey-patch.
- All `npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0`, `vitest` and `pytest` now pass cleanly.

## 2025-08-09 (0.12.21)
- Reinstated strict MyPy configuration with official SQLAlchemy plugin.
- Removed `sqlalchemy2-stubs` (conflicted with plugin).
- Fixed Alembic migration typings and env script imports; MyPy now reports zero errors.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.22)
- Phase 3 hardening kick-off: 
  * Added retry/back-off (`autoretry_for`, exponential) and late-ack to `sync_connector` task.
  * Scheduler now checks `sync_runs` table to skip profiles already running/pending, preventing duplicate jobs.
- All tests green after new connector and orchestrator test suites.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.23)
- Added Celery worker Docker image (`worker/Dockerfile`) and GitHub Actions workflow `worker.yml` to build/test/push image.
- Added unit test `test_retry_policy.py` verifying task retry settings.
- Marked Phase 3 milestone (worker image) complete in TODO.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.24)
### Fixed
* CI Postgres migrations failing with `syntax error at or near "user"` by quoting reserved table name in `20250804_02_rls.py` (`"user"`).
* Testcontainers Redis v4 compatibility: integration tests now build fallback Redis URL when `get_connection_url()` is absent (`tests/integration/test_destination_end_to_end.py`, `tests/integration/test_sync_scheduler.py`).
* Integration tests now robustly convert sync SQLAlchemy URLs (e.g. `postgresql://` or `postgresql+psycopg2://`) to `postgresql+asyncpg://` using regex to fix CI error loading async engine.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.25)
### Fixed
* Celery result backend initialization issues in CI: after setting `broker_url`/`result_backend`, tests now refresh backend via `celery_app._get_backend()` in both parent and worker processes.
* Propagate Testcontainers Postgres settings to worker subprocess so scheduler DB engine picks the correct container DB.
* Converted scheduler task to sync wrapper with async implementation and added async alias for unit tests, avoiding coroutine serialization and nested event loop errors.
### Dev
* `check_codebase.sh` gains `--ci-emulate` and `--gh`, graceful Docker detection, Alembic smoke migration, and pytest env isolation to better mirror CI locally.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.26)
- Added `--no-web-checks` flag to `check_codebase.sh`. When used (alone or with `--ci-emulate`), the script skips all web-related steps (Prettier, ESLint, Web Unit Tests, Web Build) to speed up backend-only runs.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.27)
### Changed
* `check_codebase.sh` no longer runs `--gh` (local GitHub Actions via `act`) if any prior selected steps fail; it prints a skip message and exits after the summary. This prevents noisy failures until earlier test issues are resolved.

### Fixed
* Integration tests flakiness around scheduler DB connection and event loops:
  - Refactored `backend/orchestrator/scheduler.py` to create a fresh async engine/session factory per invocation, avoiding cross-event-loop issues in CI runners.
  - `tests/integration/test_destination_end_to_end.py` and `tests/integration/test_sync_scheduler.py` now export `POSTGRES_*` env vars from the Testcontainers Postgres URL before invoking the scheduler, ensuring it connects to the same database as the test session.
  - When using in-memory broker in tests, call and await `scan_due_profiles_async()` directly instead of Celery `.apply()`/`.apply_async()` to avoid nested event loop errors.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.28)
### Changed
* `start_core_services.sh` now runs Postgres without binding the container port to the host, avoiding collisions when 5432 is already in use.
* The script detects the container's internal IP and exports it via `POSTGRES_HOST`; `POSTGRES_PORT` is fixed at 5432. Alembic migrations are now executed against this IP, fully eliminating `connection refused` errors during startup.
### Added
* `run.sh` now accepts `start` (alias of `dev`) and usage message lists all valid commands (`start|dev|prod|stop`).

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.29)
### Changed
* `run.sh` now automatically invokes `start_core_services.sh` before launching backend, Celery, and web dev/prod servers, ensuring Postgres and Redis are available and avoiding connection errors.
* It detects the Redis container IP and exports `REDIS_URL`, `CELERY_BROKER_URL`, and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` so Celery connects reliably (previous defaults pointed at localhost and failed). If Docker inspection fails (e.g., remote Docker Desktop), it falls back to `host.docker.internal`.
* Web dev server now runs with `--host 0.0.0.0` and production `serve` binds to `0.0.0.0`, so the UI is accessible via localhost or forwarded ports in remote containers.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.30)
### Added
* Web: Signup page (`web/src/pages/Signup.tsx`) with org name, email, and password; logs in automatically after successful signup.
* Routing: `/signup` route and link from `/login` to `/signup`.
### Changed
* Dev server: Vite now proxies API paths (`/auth`, `/profiles`, `/orchestrator`) to `http://localhost:8000` so the web app talks to the backend without CORS issues during development.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.31)
### Changed
* `run.sh stop` is now more robust: terminates child processes, waits for exit, then sends SIGKILL if needed, and includes pattern-based fallbacks to ensure ports are freed between restarts.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.32)
### Added
* `start_core_services.sh` now writes resolved connection settings to `.core_env` (`POSTGRES_*`, `REDIS_URL`).
* `run.sh` sources `.core_env` on start so backend/Celery consistently use the same DB/Redis endpoints.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.33)
### Fixed
* Signup/Login 500s: persist refresh tokens using a separate async DB session to avoid asyncpg "another operation is in progress" errors caused by concurrent use of the request-bound session.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.34)
### Fixed
* Signup now returns 400 with "User already exists" instead of a 500 IntegrityError when an email is already registered.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.35)
### Fixed
* Backend: enabled CORS for `http://localhost:5173` so the web UI can call the API without browser blocks.
* Profiles routes: added no-trailing-slash variants to avoid 307 redirects that can confuse dev proxies or trigger CORS preflights.
### Changed
* Vite proxy entries now use objects with `changeOrigin` and `secure:false` for more robust dev proxying.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.36)
### Added
* Destination config schema convention: `DestinationBase.config_schema()` returns JSON Schema for UI form generation.
* CleverBrag destination now implements `config_schema` (fields: `api_key` required, `base_url` optional with default).
* Backend endpoint `GET /destinations/definitions` to enumerate registered destinations and their schemas.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.37)
### Added
* Web: Destinations page to list available destinations from `/destinations/definitions` and render a minimal config form based on JSON Schema. Linked from TopNav.
* Web hook `useDestinationDefinitions` to fetch destination schemas.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.38)
### Fixed
* Destination registry now auto-discovers and imports `backend/destinations/*` at startup so definitions are available to `/destinations/definitions` and the UI dropdown populates correctly.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.39)
### Changed
* Web API client now points to backend directly in dev (http://localhost:8000) unless overridden by `VITE_API_BASE`, avoiding proxy pitfalls for new endpoints.
### Added
* Destinations page now includes an Add Destination button placeholder for creating target instances (wiring to profile config planned next).

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.40)
### Added
* DB: `DestinationTarget` model and Alembic migration.
* API: `/targets` list + create endpoints.
* Web: Destinations form now saves to `/targets` for the current org (from TopNav org selector).

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.41)
### Changed
* Targets now require `user_id` (non-null) and enforce uniqueness per (`organization_id`, `user_id`, `name`).
### Temporary
* Front-end stores a placeholder `user_id` until a proper current-user endpoint is wired; replace soon with real user info.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.42)
### Added
* Web TopNav now includes a Profiles button for quick access to `/profiles`.
### Fixed
* All web API requests now include `X-Org-ID` from localStorage so org-scoped endpoints like `/profiles` return data instead of an empty list.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.43)
### Added
* Phase 6 plan in `TODO_CleverBrag_Integration`: Full connector parity with Onyx (discovery, credentials, OAuth, UI, orchestrator wiring, security).
* DB model `Credential` and migration `20250810_05_credentials.py`.
* Basic `/credentials` list/create API.
* `GET /connectors/definitions` now enumerates Onyx connector sources.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.44)
### Added
* Security: simple Fernet helpers (`backend/security/crypto.py`) and encrypt credentials at creation in `/credentials` API (dev key fallback; replace in prod).

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.45)
### Added
* Web: Connectors page to list credentials, start OAuth flows, and add static credentials. Linked in TopNav.
* Backend: OAuth endpoints now support state storage (Redis or in-memory) and post-callback redirect to UI with `credential_id`.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.46)
### Added
* Set legacy tenant contextvar before connector runs to maximize compatibility with Onyx internals.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.47)
### Changed
* Orchestrator selects a default InputType per connector source (POLL for chat/email connectors, LOAD_STATE otherwise) instead of always LOAD_STATE.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.48)
### Added
* Persist connector checkpoints to `connectorprofile.checkpoint_json` when returned by the runner; adds migration `20250810_06_profile_checkpoint`.

## 2025-08-10 (0.12.49)
### Added
* Credential management hardening:
  - New fields on `credential`: `expires_at`, `last_refreshed_at`, `refresh_attempts`, `status`, `encryption_key_version`, `last_used_at`, `created_by_ip`, `updated_at`.
  - New audit table `credential_audit_log` with indexes for (`credential_id`, `created_at`) and (`organization_id`, `created_at`).
  - Alembic migration: `20250810_07_enhance_credential_management`.
* Security & encryption:
  - MultiFernet-based key management with versioning and rotation helpers: `encrypt_dict`, `maybe_decrypt_dict`, `needs_key_rotation`, `rotate_encryption`, `generate_new_key`, `validate_encryption_setup`.
  - Config via `CREDENTIALS_SECRET_KEY` and optional historical keys `CREDENTIALS_SECRET_KEY_V2..Vn`.
* Provider enhancements:
  - `DBCredentialsProvider` now auto-rotates encryption on access, updates `last_used_at`, and writes audit logs for access/updates/refresh attempts; includes Redis-based locking.
  - Refresh flow scaffolded (`_attempt_token_refresh`) with audit logging (connector-specific refresh still to be implemented per connector).
* APIs:
  - `/credentials` create now records metadata; responses include status/expiry fields.
  - `/credentials/{id}/test` improves validation and marks credential `expired` on auth errors; adds `needs_refresh` flag.
  - `/credentials/{id}/rotate` endpoint to manually rotate encryption.
  - `/credentials/{id}/reveal` now audit-logged; still protected by `X-Admin-Secret`.
  - New `/security` suite: `/security/encryption/status`, `/security/encryption/rotate-key`, `/security/credentials/rotate-all`, `/security/audit/credentials`, `/security/audit/credentials/stats`.
* Logging:
  - New `backend/security/audit.py` service for credential audit logging.
* Tests:
  - `tests/test_security_enhanced.py` covering crypto (rotation/versioning), audit logging, and credential provider behavior.

### Changed
* `backend/main.py` registers the new Security router.
