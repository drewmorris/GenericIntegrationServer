# Container Rebuild Steps

## Before Rebuilding
1. **Save your work** - commit any changes you want to keep
2. **Document current state** - note which fixes were applied
3. **Backup important files** if needed

## Rebuild Process
1. **VS Code**: Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
2. **Alternative**: Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"
3. **Wait for rebuild** - this will take several minutes

## After Rebuild - Test Plan
1. **Basic test**: `./simple_start.sh` 
2. **Check migrations**: `cd backend && python -m alembic current`
3. **Verify API**: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
4. **Check dependencies**: `pip list | grep -E "(psycopg|boto3|fastapi)"`

## Expected Results in Fresh Container
- ✅ **No EIO errors** (if they were filesystem corruption)
- ✅ **Clean migrations** (proper database initialization)  
- ✅ **Proper dependencies** (no conflicting installations)
- ❌ **Still have code issues** (if problems are in our fixes)

## Files to Check After Rebuild
- `backend/db/migrations/env.py` - our import fixes
- `simple_start.sh` - our startup script
- `.venv` state and dependencies

This will help us separate environment issues from code issues.
